## About Me

Hello and welcome!

My name is Marcos, a passionate software developer with over 5 years of experience designing and building robust, scalable applications for large-scale, critical environments.

My expertise is centered on backend development with the C#/.NET and Java/Spring Boot ecosystems. This is complemented by a solid foundation in frontend technologies, where I use React, JavaScript, and TypeScript to create seamless user experiences.

I am committed to delivering high-quality code through rigorous unit testing (XUnit) and am proficient in managing a wide array of databases, from SQL Server and MySQL to NoSQL solutions like Redis and Elasticsearch. Furthermore, I have certified expertise in cloud computing with Microsoft Azure (AZ-900, DP-900, SC-900).

I thrive on challenges that require strategic thinking and collaboration. As a firm believer in continuous learning, I am always seeking opportunities to contribute my skills to impactful projects.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!
